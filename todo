☐ Prioritize close resource nodes when assigning job priorty, also prefer close ones with more mining spots
☐ Spawn requests for jobs designated in a remote room
☐ handle case where we have no harvesters left and upgraders gather all the energy
    ☐ upgraders should be paused when they have no energy and our current energy ratio does not support all the spawned
    ☐ upgraders should not be requested if our energy gathering rate can't withstand the amount of harvesters, e.g. modify "maxCreeps" accordingly
    ✔ upgraders should only get resources from dropped resources, containers and tombstones @started(19-05-31 11:42) @done(19-05-31 11:56) @lasted(14m31s)
☐ There appear to be an issue with requesting too many harvesters, there should only be 8 in my current spawn, but there is 13
☐ energy mining ratio? - when we make bigger creeps, does it make sense to have all creeps on resource node to mine, how do we optimize this?
✔ initial spawn on official, everything is spawned as employed larvae @done(19-06-02 13:49)
    helps to be on the correct branch
☐ builders should find closest builder to assign
☐ spawn placement, closest to sources with most spots, not too far away from other spots, calculate that with pathing, this could be a visual tool? when there is no spawn in the room?
☐ builders should sacrifice / delete / whatever at spawn when there are no more construction jobs
